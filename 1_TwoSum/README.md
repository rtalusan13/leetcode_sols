# 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. <br>
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. <br>
You can return the answer in any order.

### Constraints: 

2 <= nums.length <= 10^4 <br>
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9 <br>
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9 <br>
Only one valid answer exists.

### Follow-up:

Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?
