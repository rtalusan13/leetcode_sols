## FAQ:

What made you start this journey?

- I am preparing for technical interviews, as well as boosting my proficiency in specific programming languages that I believe will be beneficial for my future.

Why are most of your solutions in C?

- Studying Electrical & Computer Engineering, I'm working with low-level systems and taking classes that focus on C or Assembly programming. I anticipate this will carry into my future, potentially into Hardware/Firmware roles.
