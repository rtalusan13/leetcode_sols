# leetcode_sols
My attempts at solving LeetCode problems. I am attempting to use a variety of languages, but may primarily use C/C++ or Python. I may also create attempts in languages that I have previous experience with (Java, Dart, etc.)

## FAQ:

What made you start this journey?

- I am preparing for technical interviews, as well as boosting my proficiency in specific programming languages that I believe will be beneficial for my future.

Why are most of your solutions in C?

- Studying Electrical & Computer Engineering, I'm working with low-level systems and taking classes that focus on C or Assembly programming. I anticipate this will carry into my future, potentially into Hardware/Firmware roles.

What other languages would you use?

- I am primarily using languages that have similar syntax and memory use/allocation features, compared to what I have worked with in the past. C structures translate to C++, C#, while Java translates to Dart as well. I am at a beginner proficiency for most of these languages, so as long as I build the programming mentality and get accustomed to their respective syntaxes and advantages, I will be able to better gauge what is best in certain scenarios.
