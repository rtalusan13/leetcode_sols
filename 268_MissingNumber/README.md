# Overview

This problem can be solved with two main ideas. First, we can get the total sum of the whole array and subtract it from the 
expected summation of all of the integers from [1,n], since we only need to return the missing number. Next, we can use the 
formula SUM[n] = n*(n+1)/2 to get the total sum.
